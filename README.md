# ML_BenchmarkStudy
Machine Learning using GPGPU/CPU - Benchmark study

Basic Python sample codes are taken from Theano tutorials.

Reference: http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/deeplearning.pdf

The scope of this project is to implement the hand written code recognition using different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Multi-Layer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural-net on different GPUs and CPUs. GPUs are efficient in doing Matrix (throughput) operations and CPUs are efficient in doing things fast(Latency). This project is all about the basic machine learning algorithms,implementation of algorithms in CPU/GPU and comparing the time taken for CPU/GPU to train a dataset.
